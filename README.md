# SQL-PROJECTS
This repository contains two of my SQL projects.

1- Inventory project- This project uses SQL queries to deal with the details of customers, orders, stock supplier and stock available. I have used SQL to create tables and insert the required data. Created procedures and triggers to deal with the stock changes wrt to orders placed by customers.


2- Stolen Vehicle Project- This project uses SQL to load the data of stolen vehicles in different cities of newzealand and then clean data using sql queries. I did deep analysis of the data using SQL and visualise it using POWER BI desktop. I have put all my Analysis in ppt.
